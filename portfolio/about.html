                <h2>About.</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Aaron and I am a 32 year old aspiring fullstack developer. After being a voluntary carer
                    for nearly a decade, I decided to take the plunge and pursue a career in the tech industry as a
                    developer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the moment I am currently enrolled on the Code Nation: Master Software course, where I have been
                    learning the MERN stack over the course of 12-weeks and over 480 hours of coding both alone and
                    collaboratively. I like to think of myself as a fast learner and great problem solver which can also
                    work great as part of a team or by using my own initiative.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my spare time I love learning or improving my skills in development by working on personal
                    projects and keeping up with the latest technologies. I am also an avid golfer and love to get out
                    on the course as much as possible!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am currently looking for a role as a junior developer or an apprenticeship, I believe that I would
                    be a great asset to any team and would love to hear from you if you think I would be a good fit for
                    your company.
